### What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

I would take the following steps if in case I face or witness incidents of sexual harassement.

* I would make sure that some kind of harrasement is ongoing before taking any further steps.
* I would suggest the person causing sexual harassement to stop the behaviour once or a couple of times.
* If it still repeats I would contact any of my team members or the respective incharges.
* I would also take the measure of lodging a police complaint if the incident is serious and is not controlled.
* I would collectproof throughout the process so that it wouldn't be just an innuendo.
