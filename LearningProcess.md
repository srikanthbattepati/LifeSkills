#### Active Mode
    **Active mode** of thinking is the duration during which the brain and its learning set of the neural networks are focused on a process that the brain is actually aware of but may be with new data to achieve the desired results of learning which is also known as *focused mode* .
#### Passive Mode
    **Diffused mode** of thinking is a state where the neural networks are a bit more relaxed but still are involved in the process of thinking but concentrating on the central picture in a broad or widened scope opening the door for newer ideas and approaches.
