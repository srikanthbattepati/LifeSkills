### 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

#### Active Mode
    Active mode of thinking is the duration during which the brain and its learning set of the neural networks are focused on a process that the brain is actually aware of but may be with new data to achieve the desired results of learning which is also known as focused mode .
#### Passive Mode
    Diffused mode of thinking is a state where the neural networks are a bit more relaxed but still are involved in the process of thinking but concentrating on the central picture in a broad or widened scope opening the door for newer ideas and approaches.
